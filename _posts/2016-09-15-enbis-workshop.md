  abstract: For details see [here](http://www.enbis.org/activities/events/current/532_ENBIS_16__Sensitivity_Analysis_for_Computer_Models/?_ts=166872&_ts=166872).    Computer models are used in many disciplines for making predictions when conducting physical experiments would be too costly or impractical. Typically, there will be uncertainty as to what values should be used for some of the model inputs, which induces uncertainty in the model output predictions. This course is concerned with methods for investigating how individual uncertain inputs contribute to the output uncertainty, so that model users can determine where to concentrate their resources in reducing input uncertainty. The course will include both theory and practical computational tools, implemented in the software package R. The course will also include an introduction to methods for eliciting probability distributions from experts, for the purposes of quantifying uncertainty about model inputs.

The course is designed for users of computer models, and statisticians interested in computer model uncertainty. Participants are assumed to have knowledge of standard probability distributions and basic Monte Carlo methods.

The course should enable participants to:

    understand how to quantify input importance using variance-based and decision-theoretic measures;
    calculate these measures for computationally cheap computer models, using R
    elicit a univariate probability distribution from an expert.

Please note there is a limited number of free participant slots for this course. Once the quota is full and registration no longer possible, please e-mail office@enbis.org to express your interest to be waitlisted.
